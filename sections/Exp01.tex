This is a link to the full \href{https://github.com/alla1101/-PythonHardWay-/blob/master/Exercises/E01/ex1.py}{Exercise}. 
In this Exercise, you will learn how to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run a python program.
    \item Print results.
    \item Difference between double quotation mark ( " ) and single quotation mark ( ' ).

\subsection*{How to run a python program}

First, you write a program and store it in a file with .py extension.

    $ python3 filename.py
  \end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Printing Outputs and using Comments}

Using print function, you can print any string as output.
You can also comment any line using hash \# and what comes after \# will be ignored.

\begin{python}
    print("This is Not funny");print("Yay! Printing");

    # print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
    
    print('I "said" do not touch this')
\end{python}
