\section*{Exercise 2}

This is a link to the full \href{https://github.com/alla1101/-PythonHardWay-/blob/master/E02/ex2.py}{Exercise}. 
In this Exercise, you will learn how to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use comments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using Comments on one line}

We used # in first exercise, so no need to rewrite about it

\subsection*{Commenting Multiple Lines}

According to the writer, to comment more than one line, you have to add # at the beginning of each line, so there's no easy multiline commenting to it like other languages.
